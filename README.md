# Diabetes Readmission Performance Dashboard

This Streamlit dashboard provides an interactive analysis of diabetic inpatient encounters from the 
**Diabetes 130-US Hospitals (1999–2008)** dataset. It allows users to explore readmission risk, 
length of stay, polypharmacy rates, and demographic patterns.

## 📁 Project Structure

# Streamlit App Template

This repository contains a clean starter template for building a multi-page Streamlit web application.  
It is designed for teaching, student projects, and anyone who needs a clear, minimal structure to start from.

The template includes:

- A Home page (`app.py`)
- A multi-page setup (`pages/` folder)
- An example dataset (`data/example_data.csv`)
- A simple theme configuration (`.streamlit/config.toml`)
- A complete environment setup guide (steps below)
- A `requirements.txt` file for reproducible installs

---

## 1. Prerequisites

You will need:

- Python 3.9 or higher  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- Optional: Git, if you want to clone the repository instead of downloading the ZIP file  

Check your versions:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

---

## 2. Get the project

### Option A — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/streamlit-app-template.git
cd streamlit-app-template
```

### Option B — Download ZIP

1. Click "Code" → "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Open the folder in your code editor

---

## 3. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

This isolates your project dependencies so they do not affect system-wide packages.

Inside the project folder:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

### Activate the virtual environment

macOS / Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

When activated, your terminal will show a prefix similar to:

```
(.venv)
```

---

## 4. Install dependencies

With the virtual environment activated:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs Streamlit, pandas, numpy, and any other required packages.

---

## 5. Run the Streamlit app

Run the main entry file:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Streamlit will open a local server, typically at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

If the browser does not open automatically, copy and paste this URL into your browser.

Use the sidebar navigation to switch between:

- Home  
- Overview  
- Data Explorer  
- About

### Description of folders and files

| Path | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| `app.py` | Main entry point for the app (Home page) |
| `pages/` | Additional pages; Streamlit automatically detects them |
| `data/` | Contains example datasets |
| `.streamlit/config.toml` | Optional theme and server configuration |
| `requirements.txt` | List of Python dependencies |
| `.gitignore` | Specifies which files Git should ignore |
| `README.md` | This documentation file |

---

## 7. Adding New Pages

Streamlit automatically adds any `.py` file inside the `pages/` directory as a page.

To add a new page:

1. Create a new file in `pages/`
2. Use a filename with a numeric prefix to control order, for example:

```
pages/04_Analysis.py
```

3. Add content such as:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("New Page")
st.write("This is a custom page.")
```

4. Run the app again:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The new page will appear in the sidebar.

---

## 8. Updating Dependencies

If you install additional libraries, update the requirements file:

```bash
pip install NEW_PACKAGE
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This ensures others can reproduce your environment.

---

## 9. Deployment (Short Overview)

You can deploy this Streamlit app to:

- Streamlit Community Cloud  
- Render  
- HuggingFace Spaces  
- Fly.io  
- Your own server using Docker  

For most classroom or project cases, running locally with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

is sufficient.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Streamlit command not found  
Your virtual environment may not be activated.

### Example dataset not found  
Ensure the file exists at:

```
data/example_data.csv
```

### Pages do not appear  
The folder must be named exactly:

```
pages
```

(lowercase)

## 11. Using This Template for Student Projects

You can:

- Fork this repository  
- Replace the example data with your own dataset  
- Add new multipage views  
- Build data dashboards or analysis tools  
- Submit their Streamlit project as a reproducible environment  

This ensures consistency across all student groups.
